// Package pkg contains structures and methods related to pkg definitions
// from a 'dvln' codebase.  These packages might be of any of these types:
// - a "leaf" pkg: identifying a simple "single" repo (git, hg, etc)
// - a "dvln" pkg: same as leaf but also contains a "sub" dvln (pkg manifest)
// - a "codebase" pkg: this pkg contains a codebase defn inside it (see codebase pkg)
//
// A package may be arbitrarily defined (eg: within a codebase definition file)
// or may be instantiated at a given version inside a users workspace (or by
// querying some version of a pkg on the server).  This is generic info this
// run of the tool has about the pkg (in it's current "use", eg: if querying
// a diff from the server with no workspace we may indicate what the workspace
// path would be if it were instantiated but that path won't exist whereas if
// we have a workspace we could find the package there in the workspace.
package pkg

// Defn identifies the data needed to "define" a 'dvln' "package"... *not*
// including any specific version information.  This is all about basic
// package details... where the packages "live", where they will go in the
// sandbox or working tree (ie: "workspace"), what they might have been called
// in the past or aliases that they might still need to be referenced by, what
// VCS/SCM system is storing the package and data about where to find that, ...
